# deflect: Computational structural analysis

`deflect` implements a solver and tooling for boundary value problems of structural analysis
problems. The goal is to provide an open source option for students and professionals that is fun to
work with and covers the basic needs. It is work in progress and very incomplete at this point:
don't expect anything to work.

Roadmap:

- [x] Basic 2d boundary value problems with linear-elastic trusses and/or frames
- [x] Interpolate deflection and internal forces
- [ ] Extend functionality to 3d
- [ ] Minimal web UI with solver as Wasm binary
- [ ] Serve the site somewhere, make users happy or angry
