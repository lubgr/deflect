// Package deflect implements components to solve the partial differential equations of Newton
// mechanics in their weak form and approximated with the finite element method, in particular using
// classical truss and beam elements for structural analysis. The package is concerned with element
// interpolation formulations (beams, trusses, frames, springs, ...), the mesh, boundary conditions,
// or assembling and solving the system of equations.
