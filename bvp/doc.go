// Package bvp ("boundary value problem") implements components to solve the partial differential
// equations of Newton mechanics in their weak form and approximated with the finite element method,
// in particular using classical truss and beam elements for structural analysis. The package is not
// concerned with the interpolation formulations; it deals with the mesh, boundary conditions, or
// assembling and solving the system of equations.
